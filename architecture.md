# Architectural Blueprint for Fully Autonomous Computer Use AI System

## Overview
This document describes the architecture of an AI system designed for fully autonomous computer use, capable of performing tasks like web browsing, email management, file handling, application interaction, and system administration without human intervention. The system employs a multi-agent architecture with a central orchestrator, ensuring modularity, scalability, and security.

## System Components
The system is structured as a multi-agent system with specialized agents and a central orchestrator.

### Specialized Agents
The system includes five specialized agents, each responsible for a specific task:

1. **File Handling Agent**
   - **Tool**: Open-codex CLI ([GitHub Repository](https://github.com/ymichael/open-codex)).
   - **Functionality**: Executes file operations (e.g., create, move, edit, delete) via scripts generated based on user prompts.
   - **Interface**: Accepts commands like `create_file`, `move_file`.

2. **Web Browsing Agent**
   - **Tool**: Playwright ([Playwright](https://playwright.dev/)).
   - **Functionality**: Automates browser interactions (e.g., navigate URLs, fill forms, extract data).
   - **Interface**: Supports actions like `navigate_url`, `fill_form`.

3. **Email Management Agent**
   - **Tool**: Gmail API ([Gmail API](https://developers.google.com/gmail/api)).
   - **Functionality**: Manages email operations (e.g., read, send, organize emails, handle attachments).
   - **Interface**: Provides actions like `send_email`, `read_emails`.

4. **Application Interaction Agent**
   - **Tool**: PyAutoGUI ([PyAutoGUI](https://pyautogui.readthedocs.io/)).
   - **Functionality**: Interacts with desktop applications via GUI (e.g., click buttons, type text).
   - **Interface**: Supports actions like `click_button`, `type_text`.

5. **System Administration Agent**
   - **Tool**: Ansible ([Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/)) with shell scripts as fallback.
   - **Functionality**: Manages system settings and software (e.g., install software, update configurations).
   - **Interface**: Includes actions like `install_software`, `update_settings`.

### Central Orchestrator
- **Role**: Interprets user goals, generates task plans, delegates actions to agents, monitors execution, and handles errors.
- **Implementation**:
  - Built with LangChain ([LangChain](https://langchain.com/)).
  - Uses a locally hosted, free, and open-source LLM via Ollama (e.g., Llama 3 or Mistral).
- **Features**:
  - Maintains context via memory for multi-step tasks.
  - Supports tool-use by treating agents as callable functions.
  - Implements feedback loops for error handling and adaptation.
- **Justification**: Local LLM hosting ensures privacy and eliminates external API costs, while LangChain enables robust task planning.

## Communication Protocols
- **Mechanism**: Agents communicate with the orchestrator via API calls (e.g., REST or local function calls).
- **Interfaces**: Standardized actions (e.g., `execute_task`, `report_status`) ensure interoperability.
- **Data Format**: JSON for task inputs and outputs.

## Security Measures
- **Sandboxing**: All agents run in isolated environments (e.g., Docker containers, inspired by open-codexâ€™s `run_in_container.sh`).
- **Local LLM Hosting**: Ollama-hosted LLM prevents data sharing with external services.
- **Access Controls**: Limit agent permissions (e.g., file agent restricted to specific directories).
- **Logging and Monitoring**: Track actions and detect anomalies for transparency and security.

## Validation
The architecture supports all specified tasks, ensures autonomy through the orchestrator, and prioritizes security with local hosting and sandboxing. It is designed for scalability and reliability on the target environment (Windows 10, 32GB RAM, 8GB VRAM).
