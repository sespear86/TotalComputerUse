# Requirements Document for Fully Autonomous Computer Use AI System

## Overview
This document outlines the requirements for developing an AI system capable of fully autonomous computer use, performing tasks such as web browsing, email management, file handling, application interaction, and system administration without human intervention. The system will operate on a specified environment and adhere to non-functional requirements like security and reliability.

## Tasks and Descriptions
The AI system must autonomously perform the following tasks:

1. **File Handling**
   - **Description**: Create, move, edit, and delete files and folders based on user instructions (e.g., "Organize files in Downloads folder by type").
   - **Tool**: Open-codex CLI ([GitHub Repository](https://github.com/ymichael/open-codex)).
   - **Justification**: Open-codex supports script generation and execution for file operations, integrated with large language models (LLMs) for natural language processing.

2. **Web Browsing**
   - **Description**: Navigate websites, fill forms, click buttons, and extract data (e.g., "Search for recent AI articles and summarize findings").
   - **Tool**: Playwright ([Playwright](https://playwright.dev/)).
   - **Justification**: Playwright offers robust browser automation, supporting multiple browsers and complex interactions.

3. **Email Management**
   - **Description**: Read, send, organize, and manage email attachments (e.g., "Send a weekly report to team@company.com").
   - **Tool**: Gmail API ([Gmail API](https://developers.google.com/gmail/api)).
   - **Justification**: Gmail API provides programmatic access to email operations, suitable for automation.

4. **Application Interaction**
   - **Description**: Interact with desktop applications via graphical user interface (GUI) (e.g., "Open Excel, create a chart from data.csv").
   - **Tool**: PyAutoGUI ([PyAutoGUI](https://pyautogui.readthedocs.io/)).
   - **Justification**: PyAutoGUI enables cross-platform GUI automation through mouse and keyboard simulation.

5. **System Administration**
   - **Description**: Manage system settings, install software, and perform updates (e.g., "Install Python 3.11 and update system packages").
   - **Tool**: Ansible ([Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/)) with shell scripts as fallback.
   - **Justification**: Ansible provides configuration management for automation, with shell scripts for flexibility.

## Target Environment
- **Operating System**: Windows 10.
- **Hardware**: 32GB RAM, 8GB VRAM.
- **Justification**: Windows 10 is widely used, and the specified hardware supports resource-intensive AI tasks and local LLM hosting via Ollama.

## Non-Functional Requirements
- **Security**: Implement sandboxing for all agents, limit permissions, and use a locally hosted LLM to minimize data exposure.
- **Reliability**: Ensure error handling and recovery mechanisms for uninterrupted operation.
- **Scalability**: Design agents to handle multiple tasks concurrently if hardware permits.
- **Autonomy**: Operate without human intervention, with mechanisms to request clarification if instructions are ambiguous.

## Orchestration
- **Tool**: LangChain ([LangChain](https://langchain.com/)).
- **LLM**: Locally hosted, free, and open-source model via Ollama (e.g., Llama 3 or Mistral).
- **Justification**: LangChain supports task planning and tool integration, while Ollama enables local, cost-free LLM deployment, aligning with privacy and cost requirements.
