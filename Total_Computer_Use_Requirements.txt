Thank you for providing the specific selections and additional requirements. I will complete the criteria for Phase 1: Research and Planning based on your inputs, ensuring the deliverables meet the completion criteria. Below, I’ll present the completed requirements document and architectural blueprint, tailored to your selections, including the use of a locally hosted, free, and open-source LLM via Ollama for the orchestrator. After that, I’ll confirm completion and await your approval before proceeding to the next step.
Phase 1: Research and Planning (Completed)
Objective
Define the specific tasks the AI system will perform autonomously and the target environment. Create a detailed requirements document and an architectural blueprint to guide development.
Completed Deliverables
1. Requirements Document
The requirements document outlines the tasks, environment, tools, and non-functional requirements for the AI system.
Tasks and Descriptions:

    File Handling:
        Description: Create, move, edit, and delete files and folders autonomously based on user instructions (e.g., "Organize files in Downloads folder by type").
        Tool: Open-codex CLI (GitHub Repository).
        Justification: Open-codex supports script generation and execution for file operations, with integration to LLMs for natural language processing.
    Web Browsing:
        Description: Navigate websites, fill forms, click buttons, and extract data (e.g., "Search for recent AI articles and summarize findings").
        Tool: Playwright (Playwright).
        Justification: Playwright offers robust browser automation, supporting multiple browsers and complex interactions.
    Email Management:
        Description: Read, send, organize, and manage email attachments (e.g., "Send a weekly report to team@company.com").
        Tool: Gmail API (Gmail API).
        Justification: Gmail API provides programmatic access to email operations, suitable for automation.
    Application Interaction:
        Description: Interact with desktop applications via GUI (e.g., "Open Excel, create a chart from data.csv").
        Tool: PyAutoGUI (PyAutoGUI).
        Justification: PyAutoGUI enables cross-platform GUI automation through mouse and keyboard simulation.
    System Administration:
        Description: Manage system settings, install software, and perform updates (e.g., "Install Python 3.11 and update system packages").
        Tool: Ansible (Ansible) with shell scripts as fallback.
        Justification: Ansible provides configuration management for automation, with shell scripts for flexibility.

Target Environment:

    Operating System: Windows 10.
    Hardware: 32GB RAM, 8GB VRAM.
    Justification: Windows 10 is widely used, and the specified hardware supports resource-intensive AI tasks and local LLM hosting via Ollama.

Non-Functional Requirements:

    Security: Implement sandboxing for all agents, limit permissions, and use local LLM to minimize data exposure.
    Reliability: Ensure error handling and recovery mechanisms for uninterrupted operation.
    Scalability: Design agents to handle multiple tasks concurrently if hardware permits.
    Autonomy: Operate without human intervention, with mechanisms to request clarification if instructions are ambiguous.

Orchestration:

    Tool: LangChain (LangChain).
    LLM: Locally hosted, free, and open-source model via Ollama (e.g., Llama 3 or Mistral).
    Justification: LangChain supports task planning and tool integration, while Ollama enables local, cost-free LLM deployment, aligning with privacy and cost requirements.

2. Architectural Blueprint
The architectural blueprint describes a multi-agent system with a central orchestrator, designed for fully autonomous computer use.
Components:

    Specialized Agents (5 agents):
        File Handling Agent: Uses open-codex CLI to execute file operations via scripts.
        Web Browsing Agent: Uses Playwright for browser automation.
        Email Management Agent: Uses Gmail API for email operations.
        Application Interaction Agent: Uses PyAutoGUI for GUI interactions.
        System Administration Agent: Uses Ansible for configuration management, with shell scripts for specific tasks.
    Central Orchestrator:
        Role: Interprets user goals, generates task plans, delegates actions to agents, monitors execution, and handles errors.
        Implementation: Built with LangChain, using a locally hosted LLM (e.g., Llama 3 via Ollama) for natural language understanding and task planning.
        Features: Maintains context via memory, supports tool-use (agents as functions), and implements feedback loops for adaptation.
    Communication Protocols:
        Agents communicate with the orchestrator via API calls (e.g., REST or local function calls).
        Standardized interfaces for actions (e.g., execute_task, report_status).
    Security Measures:
        Sandboxing for all agents to isolate operations (e.g., using Docker containers as inspired by open-codex’s run_in_container.sh).
        Local LLM hosting via Ollama to avoid external API data sharing.
        Access controls to limit agent permissions (e.g., file agent restricted to specific directories).
        Logging and monitoring for transparency and anomaly detection.
